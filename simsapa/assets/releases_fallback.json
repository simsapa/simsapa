also allows more complex [search query expressions](https://simsapa.github.io/features/search-queries/) on the fulltext index, which is much faster to query than the SQL database.\n\nOther improvements include:\n\n- the app keeps running in the background, system tray icon shows the window again\n- search input auto-completion allows Latin letters to match P\u0101li diacritics\n- regex globbing (`.* .+ a* a+`) and fuzzy match on fulltext searches\n- bind your OS keyboard shortcuts to open a certain window using command line arguments\n- Linux: create or update .desktop app icon
